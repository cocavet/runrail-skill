# RunRail

Use this skill when working on RunRail playbooks or when turning an operating process into a reusable multi-step workflow.

Treat a RunRail playbook as an ordered sequence of steps. Each step should have a clear job, explicit inputs, and a predictable output that the next step can consume.

## Workflow

1. Define the end goal before changing prompts or step order.
2. Identify the required inputs, variables, and external context.
3. Break the work into small steps with one responsibility each.
4. Specify the expected output format for every step.
5. Check that downstream steps can consume upstream outputs without ambiguity.
6. Simplify or merge steps only when reliability stays intact.

## Playbook Design

- Prefer short, composable steps over one large prompt.
- Give every step a single responsibility.
- Keep variable names stable and descriptive.
- Make outputs structured when another step will consume them.
- Define fallback behavior for missing data, invalid inputs, or empty results.
- Preserve the business intent of the workflow; do not optimize prompts in a way that changes the outcome.

## Prompt Writing

- Start with the task, context, and constraints.
- List the variables or source data the step receives.
- State exactly what output is expected.
- Prefer explicit instructions over style-heavy wording.
- Avoid vague requests such as "improve this" or "make it better" without success criteria.
- When useful, require JSON, markdown sections, tables, or another stable schema.

## Review Checklist

- Is the goal of the playbook clear?
- Does each step have a defined input and output?
- Are variables named consistently?
- Can another step consume the output without guessing?
- Are failure cases or missing inputs handled?
- Is any step doing too many unrelated things?

## Typical Requests

- Create a new RunRail playbook from a business process.
- Refactor one long prompt into several reliable steps.
- Review a playbook for brittleness, ambiguity, or missing variables.
- Rewrite a step so its output is easier for later steps to consume.
- Tighten a workflow that is producing inconsistent results.
